# BigFiles

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/bigfiles.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apiology/bigfiles)


Simple tool to find the largest source files in your project - maybe
to target for refactoring!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bigfiles'
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install bigfiles
```

## Usage

This is typically used as part of general use of the
[quality](https://github.com/apiology/quality) gem.  You can also run
it on the command line directly:

```sh
$ bigfiles
165: spec/big_files/big_files_spec.rb
76: .rubocop.yml
59: spec/big_files/file_with_lines_spec.rb
$
```

## Contributions

This project, as with all others, rests on the shoulders of a broad
ecosystem supported by many volunteers doing thankless work, along
with specific contributors.

In particular I'd like to call out:

* [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy) for the
  cookiecutter tool and associated examples, which keep my many
  projects building with shared boilerplate with a minimum of fuss.
